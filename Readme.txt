Game: Goodguy vs. Badguys

Objective: Kill all the bad guys in order to progress to the next level and win the game.
		(Run away from bad guys and have them kill themselves)

What you need to know:
	To move Up/Left/Down/Right: 
		W/A/S/D or Arrow Keys
	To shoot:
		Space Bar (Can only shoot after 1 step has been taken.
				Only shoots in previous direction)
	To stall:
		Return/Enter Key (Bad guys and all bullets move,
					good guy stays in place)
	To win:
		Clear all bad guys and then leave through the openings in the board
		in order to proceed to next level or after level 2 -- win the game.
	To die:
		Come in contact with a bullet, a bad guy, or a wall

You are given 3 lives, if you die with your life counter on "1" you lose the game.
If you lose in this game, shame on you... 

P.S When the bad guy shoots, in the instruction it says in the closest distance, but that doesn't make sense, so I made
it that he shoots in the longer distance toward the good guy

P.S.S I did all the extra credits: looping the game, so the good guy loops around if he tries to leave. I added a second
level, which is only accessible after clearing all enemies in first floor, and has a different board for the second level.
I also added all the sounds to the game that were required. As well as allowing bad guys the chance to shoot only on the second level
